1. Static vs. Interactive Visualizations
Static charts (like PNGs or printed graphs) give a quick snapshot of data but can’t change once they’re made.
Interactive visualizations let you zoom, filter, and drill down in real time,
so you can explore different angles without making a new plot each time.

2. Advantages of Dashboards for Real-Time Data Exploration
Dashboards combine multiple charts, tables, and metrics in one place,
giving you an at-a-glance view of key information.
Because they update automatically as new data arrives, you can spot trends,
anomalies, or urgent issues instantly and make faster decisions.

3. Improving Data Communication with Plotly and Dash
Interactive tools like Plotly and Dash let everyone—from technical experts
to business stakeholders—play with the data directly in their browser.
This hands-on approach makes insights more memorable and encourages collaboration,
since users can test “what-if” scenarios and share live views of the analysis.
